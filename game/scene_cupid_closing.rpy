    Narrator "What a bastard."
    Narrator "It’s at this moment that I notice that the street has cleared."
    Narrator "Cars are rare in this street at this time of day anyway, but I'm used to the lulling chatter and rambles of drunkern smokers and bouncers in the night."
    Narrator "A little bit too silent for my taste, even if I did wish for some peace and quiet."
    Narrator "But I don't quite regret that wish."
    Narrator "I settle into the quiet slowly but surely, my muscles untensing, my jaw unclenching."
    Narrator "All night I've been slightly on edge, wondering of the influence of Cupid upon me and my surroundings."
    Narrator "Now we play fair."
    Narrator "He's out in the open, his face bared."
    Narrator "No more random coffee stalls, heart shaped pebbles, whispers of romantic dramas, weird coincidences and washed out tropes-"
    Narrator "We both know what's going on, I can relax and face someone that knows it all, if not more than I."
    Narrator "Cupid winks at me playfully, and I don't try to hold back the rolling of my eyes-"
    Narrator "We're alone in this road, him and I."
    Narrator "It’s just me and the god of love under the starlight."
    Narrator "His eyes sharp, his grin wide, his handywork laid out in front of him."
    Narrator "He must have been watching me all day at this point."
    Narrator "I hate how proud of himself he looks, letting me just run into his layed out traps and tricks all evening."
    Narrator "Though I must admit, he's played a good game." 
    Narrator "I won't admit that to his face just yet though."
    Narrator "That wicked grin on him is really straining my nerves."

    cupid "Oh Leyla, of course I did! You made it so very, very entertaining."

    Narrator "Cupid teases as he comes to a halt and... lays down on the floor, in the middle of the street."

    Narrator "He raises his hand to make a gesture, lazily beckoning me to join him at his side."
    Narrator "And so I do."
    Narrator "Uncertain of his plans but curiousity getting the best of me, I walk toward him."
    Narrator "He has propped up one leg, layed his head on crossed arms, his eyes closed, his face at peace."
    Narrator "Looks like he's relaxing on vacation on a sandy beach somewhere, not precareously placed on the middle of the road."
    Narrator "Roolking my eyes I decide after a few moments to join him, lying down at his side."
    Narrator "And so... there we lie. Under the weirdly clear sky..."
    Narrator "For the first time in the entire day I am not overwhelmed, I am not scared or confused or worried-"
    Narrator "I just am."

    cupid "So?"

    Narrator "He doesn't change his demeanor and I grow tired of the day, so I just copy in his stead and fold my arms on my chest."
    Narrator "Closing my eyes I let out a heavy yawn, trying to make my head lay comfortably on the smooth but hard tar beneath it."

    cupid "The entire evening's soirée was ALL catered toward yourself and YOUR amusement, darling."
    cupid "Tsk, to think of the lenghts I went to, to make it such a perfect, personalized endavour in your very honour!"

    Me "Hah, how very thoughtful of you-"

    cupid "-Yes, I personally would descibe such actions as VERY thoughtful indeed!"

    Narrator "The God shifts beside me, I can hear him gesturing wildely as he speaks."
    Narrator "Kind of amusing really, that I can get such a rise out of him-"
    Narrator "The meek, mere mortal being that I am."

    Me "Though I doubt you did this all entirely for my own good-"

    Narrator "I hear him sharply inhale, ready to interrupt and stagger into a mildly annoying, yet highly defensive rant."

    Me "I have to admit it's not been without it's... Interesting moments."

    Narrator "Cupid stops in his tracks and settles a bit, lowering his arms back beside him, his breath growing calming."
    Narrator "He's waiting for elaboration- A rare moment of patience." 
    Narrator "I open my eyes again, slowly, sorting trough my feelings, trying to figure out where I'm trying to go with this."

    Me "This is the first time I've betted a god, it took me some time to try and figure it all out."
    Me "It didn't feel too good to wonder if anyone's feeligns, including my own, were true or just a trick of yours-"
    Me "But even amongst such doubts I couldn't help but let myself a hope a little."

    Narrator "Absent-mindedly I start tracing the stars in the deep dark sky."

    Narrator "I roll my eyes and let out a heaving sigh."

    Narrator "Cupid let's the moment draw on for longer than I would normally have deemed neccesary or comfortable, but for now, I don't mind."
    Narrator "I let the moment spread it's heavy but calming weight into me. 
    Narrator "The longer the seconds draw on, the less I wait for his response."
    Narrator "The more I ease into the first moment of calm I've had in so long. I know he'll answer eventually, we are dwelling between beats."
    Narrator "I don't grow nervous as he takes his time to make his next move. I just await."

    cupid "It must have been stupid Cupid that forced poor Cynthia to grin as she saw how adorable you were assessing the other customer's coffe cups, your face all scrunched up in concentration."
    cupid "Oh she had two meetings that evening by the way, she missed the first one by not rushing off immediately."

    Narrator "He must really be getting worked up."

    cupid "Come to think of it, he probably also made Zayn blush as you took off your jumper in the middle of your shift-"
