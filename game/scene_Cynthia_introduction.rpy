Narrator "With newly summoned vigour I haste through the people of this street."
Narrator "I walk and walk, and I don’t look back until I’ve reached a few blocks further and I dare to see if I have successfully evaded Randall."
Narrator "I don’t need to change pavements, but I wait until I’ve reached the next traffic light to fulfil my plan."
Narrator "Under the guise of not wanting to get hit by a car, I look left and right whilst I traverse the street- an opportunity to complete my motive."
Narrator "Ah yes, Success! He’s not there…"
Narrator "He's gone."
Narrator "Shit."
Narrator "What if he wasn’t just sent by Cupid, what if that was real?"
Narrator "A sharp panic starts to pick at my chest."
Narrator "There is a chance that I just completely messed up a perfectly reasonable and real shot at love, all because I was all too focused on winning my bet."
Narrator "I slow down my pace a little, trying to calm down the bitter feelings of regret and hindsight welling up within me."
Narrator "I could at least have gotten his number! I could have called him tomorrow, and seen if whatever… That was, that it carries over once the bet is over."
Narrator "…Although, does it REALLY count as outside of the bet, when I start to like them within the bet’s timeframe?"
Narrator "Better abstain just in case."
Narrator "I mean, I guess there's no really bad consiquences of loosing the bet? I'd just have to... admit to Cupid's gullible face that he was right?"
Narrator "Nah that actualy might be worth missing out on the love of my life, that sounds embarrasing."
Narrator "Gosh, all this thinking is exhausting me."
Narrator "I can feel the events of the last hour (IT'S ONLY BEEN AN HOUR?!) catching up with me, but I try to shake it off- I have a long shift today."

Me "“Ugh. Why, the one time I have a meet-cute? Might be the only one I’ll ever have!”"
Narrator "But just as I start to wallow in indulgent self-pity, I see it."
Narrator "My pace grinds to a halt."
Narrator "Luckily, nobody is walking directly behind me, so this halt doesn’t end in another game of human dominos."
Narrator "“AMBROSIA COFFEE” stands on the other side of the street."
Narrator "A little trolley of birch wood, red and white wheels and neon pink cursive writing flashes it's name brightly into my vision."
Narrator "At the stand, a middle-aged man with small, rounded glasses stands and smiles, passing out to-go cups with hearts plastered all over their cardboard designs."
Narrator "I'm not going insane. I’ve seen that stand."
Narrator "Whether the man himself works for Cupid or was just magically influenced to move his stand around town so I’d run into it, is guesswork."
Narrator "He certainly seems, well- normal? Normal enough to not grow too suspicious of his intention, that is."
Narrator "But the shop is certainly… weird."
Narrator "I can walk past it, make my way to work and forget this ever happened-"
Narrator "...But for some reason, I feel like that stand will follow me around tonight. And I cannot be bothered to forget and then be reminded of this bet, every time I see a neon pink light in the corner of my eye."
Narrator "Alright Cupid, if I could walk away from Randall, I can deal with whatever this obvious trap is going to be."
Narrator "…Plus I’m really tired, and I could use a pick-me-up."
Narrator "I don’t bother walking back to the traffic light but wait for a safe enough opening in traffic to safely skip over the street."
Narrator "This street is a lot emptier than the main street earlier, and the calmer, collected atmosphere harmonizes with the time of day."
Narrator "Dawn will set in soon, the last rays of sunlight shrowding the street into an inviting, comforting warmth."
Narrator "The fairy lights of little bookstores lull me into a trance."
Narrator "The soft petals of white and peach-pink roses in pots, planters and windowsills lining the walls release a sweet and floral scent as I pass them by."
Narrator "The pure sweetness of this moment charms me."
Narrator "I walk up to the stand and have to wait in line behind a few people, giving me time to start fishing for my wallet in my purse."
Narrator "..."
Narrator "Suddenly, that time is over- the customer before me walks off with a heart cup and I am left to stand before the man in the stall, smiling at me expectantly."
Narrator "I don’t want to keep him and the people behind me waiting, so I place my order and smile at the man before I resume my search."
Narrator "After another few minutes, the man’s smile no longer reaches his eyes."
Narrator "He has stopped holding out the coffee to me and has put it down, instead now resuming to pottering around within the stall."
Narrator "My face grows warm in embarrassment as I make him a shaky promise that it is “in here somewhere”, but internally? I am starting to lose hope."
Narrator "Perhaps Cupid wasn't a God and Randall not a meet-cute."
Narrator "Maybe they're pick-pockets with a specific flair for romance improv."
Narrator "..."
Narrator "I can feel the stares of everyone behind me, the patience of everyone straining, closing in like a cord in tension about to snap."
Narrator "I don’t dare to look back to see how many people are in line behind me now."
Narrator "That’s when I hear from behind me a smooth, but assertive voice."

mystery_cynthia "Excuse the long wait sir, I was beside myself. That’ll be her order aswell as an Oat Milk Latte, please."

Narrator "I turn around to seek the origin of these words."
Narrator "A gorgeous woman in what seems to be a business get-up with immense personal flare stands behind be, her hands resting on her hip."
Narrator "The vendor still doesn’t seem amused by this situation, but he refreshes his customer-service-smile."
Narrator "He gets ready to make the order whilst making small talk with the kind- or just impatient yet fashionable stranger, who has now come up beside me."

show i_cynthia laughing

Narrator "They both laugh politely about some statement which I think is supposed to be a joke? Something about how wallets sure can be elusive at times, but I don’t really listen."

show i_cynthia neutral

Narrator "I’ve also completely forgotten about my “elusive” wallet."
Narrator "Too busy watching this woman."
Narrator "There is something so – impressive about the way she holds herself."
Narrator "She projects as if she has other, more important places to be – but not in a dismissive or demeaning way."
Narrator "She just… emmates importance."

mystery_cynthia "Thank you very much sir, you too!"

Narrator "…I was too focused to notice her order being finished up."
Narrator "My breath catches in my throat as I try to awaken quickly, to not lose the chance to thank her for her action before she whisks away in a cloud of importance."
Narrator "It’s only now that I truly realize what happens and I am wrecked with guilt that I was too busy staring at this woman to remember to decline her offer to pay for me."
Narrator "I know my wallet is in there, I would just have needed another minute or so to find it…"
Me "Thank you so much, just you wait one second, I will pay you back immediately!"

Narrator "I’m about to start jumping into my search once more when she gently places her hand on my shoulder and gives it a slight squeeze."
Narrator "She is touching me. I wasn’t expecting that."
Narrator "Embarrassed blushing over an awkward situation is quickly replaced by my face growing red out of fluster."
Narrator "At least she won’t know the difference, she’s only seen me this way which is… embarrassing, but at least she could assume I’m just sunburned instead of coming down with an extreme case of gay panic."

show i_cynthia mischievous

Narrator "Whilst my thoughts are running wild, she smiles gently."
Narrator "...Less toward me and more in conversation with the vendor."

mystery_cynthia "We will do that in a minute, we should first make some space to that this kind man can continue his work, right?"

Narrator "It’s worded like a question, but I know it isn’t."
Narrator "She takes my arm firmly but not with aggression or too much pressure."
Narrator "It's just enough to be assertive and take me out of the cue with her."
Narrator "She steers me toward a protruding ledge at the base of the romantic little bookstore's shop window."
Narrator "White, wooden arches frame pink tainted glass, dark green vines with small yellow flowers wrap gently along the shop's brick walls, fluttering gently in the summer evening's breeze."

show i_cynthia neutral

Narrator "I immediately take her cue, just following her direction and seating myself next to her, looking out at the street before us."
Narrator "She doesn’t give me the feeling of needing to think, ask questions, figure out what want to do next."
Narrator "She seems to want to take the lead, and I’m all to happy to give it to her."

show i_cynthia laughing

mystery_cynthia "Well, that was just precious."
Narrator "I’m struck by her directness as she laughs to herself, sharp but affectionate, leading her neon pink cup to her lips."
Narrator "Our cups are pink."
Narrator "Were the other cups pink too?"
Narrator "I shake off the instinct to delve further into the rabbit hole potential of “cup mysteries” and process her words."

show i_cynthia mischievous

Me "Wait, what?"

Narrator "The woman ignores my question and continues drinking her coffee, all the way causally letting her eyes wander over me, tilting her head slightly as she seems to ponder something."
Narrator "She finally decides on her course of action and leans back against the wall surrounding the shop window."

#Cynthia introduces herself 
cynthia "My name is Cynthia."

$ met_cynthia = True

cynthia "There."
cynthia "That’s easy, isn’t it? My name is – and then you insert your own name so that the other person knows who they have the pleasure of meeting."
Narrator "Her smile fades, and her cross, neutral expression comes to show."
cynthia "Try it."

Narrator "I decide to take my chances on having a voice when I begin to speak."
Narrator "I have to stop myself from laughing ecstatically when my voice is clear and not as croaky as I’d feared."

show i_cynthia neutral

Me "Sorry yea, I’m a bit all over the place- My name is- Leyla."

Narrator "Cynthia. Her name fits her so well, I ponder."
Narrator "She feels soft, fresh and floral, yet sharp and demanding of your attention, cutting through all else- like the scent of a Hyacynthe."
Narrator "Elegant, sharp, and… Oh she’s begun to lean toward me, her face getting closer and closer than my blood pressure can probably handle."
Narrator "Her hand distends, reaching up toward and gently cupping the side of my face, playfully letting her thumb glide over my cheek."
Narrator "How her fingertips aren’t seared off by the scolding heat probably being emitted from my skin, eludes me."

cynthia "Hmm..."

Narrator "She holds my head in place, not that I'd dare to move."
Narrator "Her brown eyes pierce trough me, I feel like I am being assesed, watched, a primal instinct of fear mixed with excitement bubbelign up within me"
Narrator "I let out an almost inaudible squak as she leans my head slighly to the side suddenly, her breath warm and sweet on my skin."

cynthia "So, she’s pretty and she speaks…"

Narrator "I lose my cool entirely and take a shaky breath as she softly glides her thumb from my cheek, then over my chin and back again, letting her touch linger as it passes over the side of my lower lip."

show i_cynthia blushing

cynthia "…what can’t she do?"

Narrator "Luckily, before I die, she pulls away again, focusing her eyes almost in disinterest on the cars passing by, drinking from her coffee at a steady pace."

Me "Well apparently finding my own possessions is outside of my capabilities."

Narrator "I don’t think she expected me to say anything- at least no so pointedly as I did."
Narrator "Her eyes dart back onto me the moment I speak, curiosity and playfulness creeping up within them."

show i_cynthia mischievous

cynthia "Very good point. Well, we can’t have it all now, can we."

Me "Apparently not. So, what are you then, going around buying people coffee? A millionaire, a helpless flirt, or perhaps a selfless martyr?"

Narrator "I’m very proud of having found my voice, and I decide to lean into this random surge of confidence for as long as can I ride it’s wave."
Narrator "Cynthia watched me intently, by the looks of her she can tell I'm like a foal confidently running across the stable not really having learned how to- run yet."
Narrator "But for now the Foal is stumbeling and she is curious to see where it will go next, I imagine."

cynthia "A bit of all of the above perhaps?"
cynthia "Not quite a millionaire, yet, but I run my own publishing company so- perhaps enough to qualify in your eyes, I hope."
cynthia "But as it comes to your coffee-"
cynthia "Everyone likes to refer to themselves as selfless, but I’ll admit, I acted very much in my own interest here."
cynthia "As it comes to the “helpless flirt” alligation-" 
cynthia "I mean, it seems to be working out well for me so far, wouldn’t you agree?"

Narrator "I think I’ve had so much shyness today, that at this point I’ve just reached my limit. I am too shy to be shy anymore."
Narrator "And hell, this might all be Cupid acting up so, what’s the damage in enjoying this a bit?"
Narrator "Plus, at this point I might aswell get used to it, if this turns out to be a common occurrence tonight…"
Narrator "I’ve had enough of being too nervous to speak, I’ll try and lean into her game."
Narrator "…As long as the confidence holds on at least."

show i_cynthia neutral

Me "Sounds like an intriguing combination… Especially the latter parts."
Me "Forgive me my shyness, by the way, it’s difficult to concentrate when my mind goes blank at the sight of you."

show i_cynthia blushing

Narrator "Cynthia laughs loudly at this, but she doesn’t quite manage to hide the soft blush emerging on her face as I speak."
Narrator "I love how the shade of deep red creeps slowly onto her cheeks, she must feel the warmth of it too, lowering her face a bit behind her cup."

cynthia "Gosh, you’re wittier than I anticipated…"

show i_cynthia neutral

Me "Sorry to disappoint?"

show i_cynthia laughing

cynthia "Oh no need to apologize…"

Narrator "She leans over again, but I don’t flinch this time."
Narrator "The exhilaration of the tension is takes me over…"
Narrator "I don't shy away from meeting her gaze this time."
Narrator "The Oh so familiar, titilating nervousnous of shying away from somone's stare is replaced by something new, something way more intriguing."

show i_cynthia neutral

Narrator "She is challenging me, I know that she’s testing how long I can hold on to this newly found strength until it becomes too much for me and I get flustered beyond comprehension once more."
Narrator "But I stand my ground."
Narrator "She lets her pause linger, her eyes drilling into mine, absent-mindedly biting the inside of her lip…"
Narrator "She is threatening to pull me deeper, and deeper into her gaze."
Narrator "But I stand my ground."
Narrator "The tension is raw and earned, we are vulnerable the two of us, with every second we stay this way, another layer of our attraction is revealed."
Narrator "But we stay."
Narrator "Finally, she reaches over and lets her index finger fall under a stray strand of my hair, slowly and tentatively gliding it toward the side of my face."
Narrator "She tucks the hair neatly behind my ear, her nail always running barely over my skin in a way that makes shivers run up my spine."
Narrator "She takes her hand back slowly, finally giving me enough space to let me take a freeing breath."

show i_cynthia blushing

cynthia "You’re not what I expected you to be."
cynthia "You’re oh so much better."

Narrator "She stares at me a moment longer, but then pulls away, the moment sweetly drawing to a close."
Narrator "She thinks as she frowns into her coffee, some plan in the works once more."
Narrator "I watch as she finishes her drink, now noticing that I haven’t taken a single sip from mine."
Narrator "The heat of the brown, swirling liquid within has radiated onto the cup it occupies."
Narrator "I am suddenly hit with the realization, that the heat in question is higher than comfortable, and has been slowly increasing in this entire time, my skin staying bare on the scolding cup…"
Narrator "I quickly pass the cup on to my other hand, the slightly scloded skin of the other sharply recovering from it's burn."

show i_cynthia neutral

Narrator "I was just a bit too distracted to notice."
Narrator "By the time I’m done realizing and fixing my coffee cup issue, I look up to see her holding a pencil in her hand, arms crossed, gaze deeply set on watching me."
Narrator "I grow excited noticing how she was watching me without noticing it entirely- it’s a nice surprise to look up and see someone so astutely observing you, drinking up you’re every move."
Narrator "The grin on my face is half intentional, half just an immediate reaction to my thoughts of her."
