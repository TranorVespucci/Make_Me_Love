    Narrator "The next few hours went by quickly."
    Narrator "Two people threw up outside of the toilets, a few people found their match for the night or got their hearts broken, but overall, a pretty normal night."
    Narrator "...Well, that and a peculiar bachelorette party incident."
    Narrator "The maid of honour was revealed to have had an affair with the bride-to-be’s fiancé, so we had to kick them out before our property got too damaged."
    Narrator "It was a lot of love drama, more than on a normal night."
    Narrator "...I can’t help but believe that I know who’s responsible."
    Narrator "The weirdest moment so far, however, is now-"
    Narrator "Cause now, as I’m standing behind the bar and the night has reached its midpoint..."
    Narrator "...She walks in."

    Narrator "She doesn’t see me at first."
    Narrator "She comes in, wearing the same things she wore at her coffee break. "
    Narrator "She looks tired, but not too tired for one last drink to process whatever happened at that last meeting of hers."
    Narrator "Her hair isn’t as perfectly in place as it had been earlier, loose strands find their way whimsically into the air and her corset sits a little lop-sidedly." 
    Narrator "Her make-up is smudged, and the chain of her left earring keeps getting caught on itself."
    Narrator "She looks even more beautiful than I remember. "
    Narrator "I enjoy watching her and hold my breath, hoping the moment lasts a little longer before she sees me."
    Narrator "There’s something so ethereal about her, as she acts purely without the bias of my presence."
    Narrator "It’s wonderful to see her politely apologize to guests as she wants to walk past them, as she fixes her hairpins back into place, rolls back down her collar and wipes away fallen mascara from under her eyes."
    Narrator "She’s not serene, that’s not the right word- she still holds herself high, walks with purpose and assesses everything around her critically."
    Narrator "But theres a weight on her shoulders, and serenity implies a lightness to her ever present grace."
    Narrator "No, the serenity only sets in when she sees me."

    Narrator "And after the first initial expression of surprise, a sly smile creeps into her face."
    Narrator "I can’t help but smile as well- though it was wonderful to see her act without my bias, the way she looks at me makes me feel- "
    Narrator "No."
    Narrator "This is getting crazy"
    Narrator "This is too many people, too much, too many feelings and none of them are even real."
    Narrator "Amazing."
    Narrator "This has been a night to overwhelm, and though I am happy to see her, though this night has been exciting like not many others have been recently, I... I'm growing very drained of it all."
    Narrator "Perhaps I should internally reject all feeling I have tonight. I've been trying that but... that is draining beyond belief."
    Narrator "Maybe just... Accepting them for tonight, pondering them after I've had some sleep might be a wiser course of action?"
    Narrator "Before I have time to make up my mind over if I should now indulge on tonight’s feelings or not, she is in front of the bar."
    narrator "She taps her well-manicured nails along the bar infront of me, demanding, as she does, steadily and succesfully, my full attention."
    Narrator "She slides onto a stool and props up her face on her hands."
    Narrator "The rythm of her tapping upon the bar is echoed upon her own face as she continues the beat slowly, her fingers gently jumping over her cheeks."
    Narrator "I wonder if it's just a random pattern, just some instictive sequence, or a beat to amelodie I can only try and guess."

    cynthia "Fancy seeing you here-" 

    Narrator "Cynthia doesn't bother to remove her hands from her face, simple turning her head in an ever so slightly downward motion to gesture towardard the bar."
    
    cynthia "I see this is where you had to hurry off to."
    
    Narrator "Her face finds it's final resting place at a slight angle, her head propped up slightly leaning to the side- quizzicle, playful and ready to play with my emotions again, I'm sure."

    Narrator "I can’t help myself- "
    Narrator "I copy her pose and playfully lean my elbows on the bar opposite her, chin on my hands, my head leant slightly to the side to mirror her playful expression."
    Narrator "My stomach leaps with accomplished giddiness as I grow way too proud of myself, realizing her reaction."
    Narrator "I've inspires a spark in her expression, eyes sharply honed in and focused again, tracking their target, grin widening."
    Narrator "Following the almost animalistic focus and sharpness of her eyes, I am almost suprised when her smile reveals that instead of sharp fangs, her canines are as human as anyone elses."

    Me "Well, as you can see Mrs. “It may be 8 pm, but I have another meeting scheduled for today”, I also have important business to attend to..."

    Narrator "A playful chuckle escaping her, she tilts her head to the opposite direction biting her lower lip sharply."
    Narrator "Her look pierces into me with an intensity, which feels like its is seconds away from actually drawing blood."
    Narrator "It wanders with curelty and bliss from my own lips, over to my eyes and back again."

    cynthia "Oh, is that so?"
    cynthia "And what could possibly be that important?"

    Narrator "Exhasburation flows within me, adrenalin rushing trough my veins as I meet Cynthia's stare."
    Narrator "This... this feels dangerous."
    Narrator "We both feel it."
    Narrator "Like I am running low on luck, like I am on the verge of breaking under her rule, like I am challenging a being beyond by strenth."
    Narrator "As long as I walk that line, a primal excitement befalls me."
    Narrator "Riding this absolute power trip, I am aware that I thrive in confidence due to the safety of the bar between her and I."
    Narrator "Both due to proximity, as well as this being my home turf. My lair."
    Narrator "I lean forward toward her face teasingly, slowly inching."

    Narrator "She stays in place, but I see her grin fall as that rewarding blush reveals itself on her cheeks."
    narrator "Watching her let out one single, shaky breath to calm herself, her attention glued to me, awaiting my next move, rewards me and ecourgages me in my approach."
    Narrator "I lean past her face toward her ear... and whisper. "

    Me "I have work of great importance-" 
    me "I await your order."

    Narrator "I lean back slowly, allowing me to view her face."
    Narrator "Her lips are softly, sligtly agape, cheecks deeply flushed, breath labored, her eyes helplessly following my movement, like it phsycially pains her to feel me get away."
    Narrator "All the while I watch her, a creature of grace yet she's lost all traces of her sharpness."
    Narrator "Neither of us expected to switch roles tonight."
    Narrator "But now she is the one staring at me lost, desiring, left wanting more."
    Narrator "My body staightens out as I finally stand upright, unable to let the tension building moment drown on for any longer."
    Narrator "Resuming my responsibilities, I playfully gesture toward the wall behind me, stacked to the ceiling with liquors, beverages and- well- alcohol."

    Me "I’m a bartender honey, It's my one and only purpose to fulfill your desires."
    Me "So... What can I do for you?"

    Narrator "Cynthia props herself back up and crosses her arms, shaking off the tension of the previous moment."
    Narrator "The lost proximity between the both of us has given her a moment to recover, even, to my pride, clearing her throat."

    cynthia "Does the desire have to be… liquor related?"

    Narrator "I nod with a playful sadness and begin waving my hands elaborately in front of the bottles, doing my best impression of a salesman."

    cynthia "Too bad- well then, I expect an expresso martini will have to do for now..."
    cynthia "I feel like choosing coffee today has been pretty successful choice so far, why stop now-"

    Narrator "Suddenly, she snorts to herself, like she’s pondering whether to say something or not."
    Narrator "...And she can't quite take herself seriously during."

        Narrator "I notice that I might have let my stare linger on her for a bit too long but… It’s very difficult to tear myself away from her."
        Narrator "It's with slight jealousy that I recognize that the tables have turned again."
        Narrator "She's returned to where she demands to be at most times- Asserting the upper hand."

        Narrator "That's hot too."

        Narrator "She’s funny that way- she can get shy, but out of vulnerability I think and less out of awkwardness with herself…"

    Narrator "Zayn crosses his arms and projects casualness as he leans back his head and raises his arms to stretch his neck. "
    Narrator "Which isn’t attractive to me at all, it leaves me completely unaffected."
    Narrator "...Help."

    Narrator "Amazing. Now we have awkward silence. Best item on our menu, that's for sure."
    Narrator "I’m being dramatic, it luckily doesn’t go on for long- It’s just a beat in time, but it's extremely unsetteling."
    Narrator "I can’t believe I didn’t see him come back!"

    Me "I'll go soon, I'll just finish up my orders..."

    Narrator "I expect him to nodd and continue on with whatever he's up to, but to my suprise, he stands his ground, brow furrowing in frustration."
    Narrator "Hyperaware of my surroundings I see Cynthia out of the corner of my eye tending to the pins in her hair, not overtly watching us, but following along subtely."
    Narrator "Painfully aware of the both of them, I try to settle my nerves and project an air of casualness, though Zayn knows me well."
    Narrator "His face, for only a moment, twitches into a grimace and back again. He can ready my awkwardness and is thoroughly displeased by it."
    Narrator "Wait..."
    Narrator "Is he... jealous?"
    Narrator "Kinda hot, honestly."

    zayn "No."

    Me "What do you mean “No”?"

    Narrator "Zayn's lip curls in displeasure to my defiance. He folds his arms and pops his chin up slitghtly. This has turned into some weird stand-off."
