    Narrator "Suddenly, the weird pretty man with pink hair, a mischevious smile and oh yea, WINGS, is gone."
    Narrator "He leaves me behing gawking at the place he was previously, my mind racing to figure out the current state of my sanity."
    Narrator "After a minute or so I decide to just... Try and coninue on with my day?"
    Narrator "Can't very well show up to work late and tell them 'Oh yea, sorry about leaving you to open alone Zayn, but Featherman was in the mood for devine bets today!'"
    Narrator "It's actually a bit tempting. Just to get him riled up a bit."
    Narrator "..."
    Narrator "Dispersed by the recent and SLIGHTLY bewildering events, I stumble my way through the mass of pedestrians on the street."
    Narrator "They’re all way too absorbed in their worlds to notice my staggering step."
    Narrator "I finally make it to a bench by the side of the street without knocking someone over,"
    Narrator "-although I had a very, very close encounter with an elderly woman and her comparably large poodle in my last strides."
    Narrator "I rub my stinging eyes as I try to make sense of the last minutes."
    Narrator "The following relief is only temporary, my eyes becoming so sore from the pressure, that my vision is even more blurry than before."
    Narrator "I let my thoughts catch up for a moment, as I accept that the world is now made up of gently swirling pavement and street signs that are never quite in focus enough to be eligible."
    Narrator "That…"
    Narrator "That can’t have been real?"
    Narrator "What am I even supposed to do in a situation like this?"
    Narrator "Like what, do Gods normally just… interrupt people’s days like that?"
    Narrator "Confuse the hell out of them? "
    Narrator "Make them doubt their own sanity based on- what? "
    Narrator "No rhyme or reason, just… coincidence and whim?"
    Narrator "That would be totally- "
    extend "No that’s actually entirely plausible, checks out."
    Narrator "Ok."
    Narrator "Deal’s a deal."
    Narrator "Can’t be that difficult anyway, right? Just continue life as is, nobody’s lined up to win my heart so far, and they won’t start now."
    Narrator "My vision starts to reset slowly and the fog that rests heavily on my brain clears a little."
    Narrator "I somehow successfully suppress a heavy, bellowing laugh from emerging at the realization of how ridiculous my life has just become-"
    Narrator "- just in time to realize that I must be running late for work at this point."
    Narrator "I wait for another moment on that increasingly uncomfortable bench till my vision clears and I’m able to read the sign of the coffee booth on the other side of the street."
    Narrator "Unfortunately, I’m too busy wondering if it has always had the words “AMBROSIA COFFEE” cursively adorning its side, to notice the passer-by running straight past the bench-"
    #adjust this line later
    Narrator "Right where I was planning to start walking once more."

    mystery_randall "Fu-"
    Narrator "He didn’t seem to be expecting my move either, as our bodies collide with a heavy thunk and we both lose our bearings and fall, inelegantly, on concrete pavement."

    Me "Oh shit, I’m so sorry!"

    Narrator "I sit up rashly, ignoring the dull pain in my wrist where I awkwardly collided with the concrete, trying to brace my fall."
    Narrator "The handsome stranger and I are surrounded by a widely dispersed stack of letters, which, apart from a minor few that are a bit more torn and bent than they probably were before, seem relatively unharmed."
    Narrator "I immediately jump to action and crawl around alongside him, stuffing the letters back into the now-empty bag marked with a postal symbol. "

    show i_mysteryR blushing

    Narrator "He lets out an awkward chuckle, but the crinkling around his eyes as he smiles is genuine."

    mystery_randall "Oh no worries, I shouldn’t have been running anyway- safety hazard and- Ehm- Such."

    show i_mysteryR neutral

    Me "All good."
    Narrator "Still slightly distracted by my thoughts and my lungs straining to be filled with air again, that's all I can really get out."
    Narrator "I put on my customer-service smile for him as I pull out a crumpled letter from under my shoe."
    Narrator "It is only now that I take a proper look at him."
    Narrator "I’ve caught him in a hurry of sorts." 
    Narrator "His expression strains as he rushes to assemble his stack of letters once more and scans the floor carefully for strays."
    Narrator "But there is also a clarity, a calmness to him."
    Narrator "He is in a rush, but he still takes his time to be thorough as he works. He is careful to not inconvenience the other passers-by and apologizes to those rushing past."
    Narrator "In between all this chaos, I can see him stealing glances at me out of the corner of my eye."
    Narrator "His gaze burns on my skin and I turn away, hoping that my face won’t blush and betray me, giving the intensity of the moment away."
    Narrator "He isn’t even looking at me in a way of trying to assess my looks- it’s way worse."
    Narrator "An analyzing focus shapes his expression, pressing his lips together in concentration."
    Narrator "He is trying to assess if I’m alright, if I got hurt in the fall- and when he clocks me being careful with my wrist, he grimaces in regret."
    Narrator "I intensely study a letter adressed to some “MARGOT MULBERRY” for reasons definetly based entirely on curiosity."
    Narrator "Eventually the time I could spend assesing Ms. Mulberry's adress reaches it's natural limit and, out of insinct, my gaze finds his."
    Narrator "As he looks at me and we both are aware of our attention falling upon the other, his brow unfurrows."

    show i_mysteryR blushing

    Narrator "I internally curse myself for looking away from Ms. Mulberry, overwhelmed by the changes in his face."
    Narrator "For when his assessment ends and his worry is dampened, what remains at last is his gentleness."
    Narrator "He looks at me with earnestness."
    Narrator "A pure look of joyous lightlessness befalls him, and I am forced to look away within the course of just a few seconds, suddenly depicting a heightened interest in assembling the leftover letters"
    Narrator "He does the same besides me, but in his hovering I can feel him trying to catch my eye once more."
    Narrator "I’d love to look at him more- I’d love to meet his gaze… \n
            It feels like an easy choice- like it’s the most natural thing to do, to see and be seen by him."
    Narrator "But I just can’t help myself, I can’t help but avoid his eyes sheepishly, his gaze burns upon me more intensely than the afternoon sun earlier today."

    show i_mysteryR blushing

    Narrator "Perhaps if I turn away, my voice will project some amount of confidence."
    Narrator "Ahem. Here goes."

    Me "I'm so sorry about this, I should have looked where I was going..."
    Me "How many of these are there, my go-"
    Narrator "You know what? No, I'm staying away from that word now, not going to risk amusing him."
    Me "…My goodness."

    show i_mysteryR laughing

    Narrator "The man halts his process of stacking up the collected letters into different piles, sorting them by some kind of system that I cannot be bothered to try and discern."
    Narrator "He lets out a hearty laugh that brightens up his entire being."

    mystery_randall "A few, but luckily the last of this batch."

    Narrator "I decide to take up the last remaining space on the bench that isn’t aldread occupied by the ever-increasing number of letter-stacks. "
    Narrator "The mystery Mailman is still crouching on the floor organizing his delivery when he starts grinning to himself sheepishly, the kind you get when you remember an old joke you can never seem to quite get bored of quoting."

    show i_mysteryR mischievous

    mystery_randall "I ought to thank you really."
    
    Narrator "I stop playing with the rim of a letter absent-mindedly, my sense of curiosity overriding my shyness."

    Me "What do you mean?"

    show i_mysteryR neutral

    Narrator "He smiles. Now he's the one averting my gaze- though I doubt out of shyness. He seems more confident than I. I think?"

    show i_mysteryR laughing

    mystery_randall "Well I was in such a rush earlier, I kinda messed up the sorting system for these- So now I have a chance to actually do it right."

    show i_mysteryR neutral

    Me "Aren’t you still in a rush though? I mean, I’m not really one to judge in this situation, but you didn’t really give off “taking my time”-kinda vibes."

    Narrator "For a second I think he is too absorbed in his work to have heard me until he responds- without looking up."

    mystery_randall "I wasn’t really in a necessary rush- I was just trying to get home early before my next shift."

    Narrator "He assigns the last of his letters and looks up to meet my gaze."

    Narrator "The suddenly arisen attention makes it hit more intensely than any previous moment had. And this time- I’m too frozen, to caught off-guard to be able to look away."

    show i_mysteryR blushing

    mystery_randall "But for now, I still have time."

    Narrator "He then reaches over and gently takes the final remaining letter out of my hand and puts it slowly onto a last remaining pile."
    Narrator "For a moment we just stay that way."
    Narrator "It feels peaceful."
    Narrator "I breathe in, like im about to say something but I decide against it."
    Narrator "Neither of us want this moment to end, for the peace to fall away."
    Narrator "Life feels simpler, calmer in the warmth of this stranger's smile."
    Narrator "..."
    Narrator "Ok, Cupid."
    Narrator "I see I underrestimated just how tricky this night might become…"

    show i_mysteryR neutral

    Narrator "I suddenly stand up, desperately trying to shake off this weird love magic trick that’s being played on me."
    Narrator "Yes, that's exactly all it is."
    Narrator "It’s all just one magic trick! Get yourself together Layla, no need to make a fool of yourself falling for any of this."

    Me "Well I AM actually in a rush, so I should get going."

    Narrator "The Mailman stands up surprised, seemingly catching himself and getting a bit embarrassed for getting side-tracked."

    mystery_randall "Oh yea you should probably get going then-"

    Narrator "He haphazardly stands up and starts grabbing the stacks of mail and storing them more clumsily than swiftly in his bag."

    mystery_randall "-I also should get going in a minute anyway."
    mystery_randall "-I mean, I DO still have time-"
    mystery_randall "-but I also DO still have a shift coming up!"
    mystery_randall "-aaaand it would be cool to eat something beforehand-"
    mystery_randall "-ooor maybe get some rest-"
    mystery_randall "-ah, I could also be productive, maybe, yea!"
    mystery_randall "-yea, it would be great to work a bit more on my portfolio-"
    mystery_randall "-yea that, or I could call my mom and ask her how the cat talent-show went-"
    mystery_randall "-I mean, I doubt that Libby didn't get any prizes this year, she's a real talent-"
    mystery_randall "-but Frog has to really get over himself, his attitude really brings the points doOOOOWWNN---"

    Narrator "...Whilst the mailman is sucessful in his venture of picking up the last mailstacks, amidst his rambling, he loses his grip on the last one, the pile threatening to fall. Again."

    show i_mysteryR blushing

    Narrator "With a swift swoop, I manage to catch the pile just in time that it doesn’t fall."
    Narrator "My hands instinctively clasp around the envelopes, as well as the fingers enveloping them."
    Narrator "We stand there, frozen for a moment."
    Narrator "Staring at first at the stack of envelopes, and then at each other."
    Narrator "His hands are large and warm, the slightly roughness of his skin pleasently scratching a little where my soft palms and fingers hold."
    Narrator "I’m suddenly aware of just how close we’re standing… \n
                He smells of Citrus and Sandalwood, crisp, soft and comforting."
    Narrator "My breathing feels laboured and straining as I try to remember how my body used to breathe casually on it's own."
    Narrator "If I hadn’t just been persuaded to not meddle with the games of Gods, I’d pray for him not to notice the sweatiness of my palms or hear the obnoxious drumming of my heart."
    Narrator "I curse at my body for giving away my nerves, for being inept at the simple presence of... Whoever this is."
    Narrator "This entire time he has just been staring at me."
    Narrator "His breath as deepened alongside mine and his eyes carefully trace the pattern of our fingers laced upon another, then the curve of my lips..."
    Narrator "He catches himself apparently as his smile widens warmly and his eyes wander back to mine."

    mystery_randall "Randall."
    mystery_randall "I mean-"

    Narrator "I pull back my hands and sheepishly fold them behind my back as he starts, slowly, moving the pile toward his open bag."
    Narrator "Now in sole custody of the pile, Randall carefully parks it within the bag, laughing off his now apparent awkwardness."

    randall "Well, Layla, I know you need to run but… I hope I'll run into you again sometime."

    Narrator "Here's you're reminder that this game is an anti-dating sim visual novel, so you won't get the chance to choose you're interactions with the characters!"
    Narrator "You get to read Layla's interaction with her Love Interests and see if she can resist falling for them as they try to make her laugh- that's where you come in!"
    Narrator "You control wether a joke lands or not- and thereby, if she falls for them..."
    Narrator "Remember, Layla doesn't want to fall for anyone, but your goals do not have to align with hers..."
