    Narrator "I blink."
    Narrator "I mean- what else am I supposed to do in a moment like this?"
    Narrator "Dispersed by the recent and SLIGHTLY bewildering events, I stumble my way through the mass of pedestrians on the street."
    Narrator "They’re all way too absorbed in their worlds to notice my staggering step."
    Narrator "I finally make it to a bench by the side of the street without knocking someone over, although I had a very, very close encounter with an elderly woman and her comparably large poodle in my last strides."
    Narrator "I rub my stinging eyes as I try to make sense of the last minutes."
    Narrator "The following relief is only temporary, my eyes becoming so sore from the pressure, that my vision is even more blurry than before."
    Narrator "I let my thoughts catch up for a moment, as I accept that the world is now made up of gently swirling pavement and street signs that are never quite in focus enough to be eligible."
    Narrator "That…"
    Narrator "That can’t have been real?"
    Narrator "What am I even supposed to do in a situation like this?"
    Narrator "Like what, do Gods normally just… interrupt people’s days like that?"
    Narrator "Confuse the hell out of them? "
    Narrator "Make them doubt their own sanity based on- what? "
    Narrator "No rhyme or reason, just… coincidence and whim?"
    Narrator "That would be totally- "
    extend "No that’s actually entirely plausible, checks out."
    Narrator "Ok."
    Narrator "Deal’s a deal."
    Narrator "Can’t be that difficult anyway, right? Just continue life as is, nobody’s lined up to win my heart and they won’t start now."
    Narrator "My vision starts to reset slowly and the fog that rests heavily on my brain clears a little."
    Narrator "I somehow successfully suppress a heavy, bellowing laugh from emerging at the realization of how ridiculous my life has just become-"
    Narrator "- just in time to realize that I must be running late for work at this point."
    Narrator "I wait for another moment on that increasingly uncomfortable bench till my vision clears and I’m able to read the sign of the coffee booth on the other side of the street."
    Narrator "Unfortunately, I’m too busy wondering if it has always had the words “AMBROSIA COFFEE” cursively adorning its side, to notice the passer-by running straight past the bend-"
    #adjust this line later
    Narrator "Right, where I was planning to start planning once more."

    mystery_randall "Fu-"
    Narrator "He didn’t seem to be expecting my move either, as our bodies collide with a heavy thunk and we both lose our bearings and fall, inelegantly, onto the concrete."

    Me "Oh my God, I’m so sorry!"

    Narrator "I sit up rashly, ignoring the dull pains in my arms where I awkwardly collide with the concrete, trying to brace my fall. "
    Narrator "The handsome stranger and I are surrounded by a widely dispersed stack of letters, which, apart from a minor few that were a bit more torn and bent than they probably had been before, seemed relatively unharmed."
    Narrator "I immediately jump to action and crawl around alongside him, stuffing the letters back into the now-empty bag marked with a postal symbol. "

    show i_mysteryR blushing

    Narrator "He lets out an awkward chuckle, but the crinkling around his eyes as he smiles is genuine."

    mystery_randall "Oh no worries, I shouldn’t have been running anyway- safety hazard and- Ehm- Such."

    show i_mysteryR neutral

    Narrator "It is only then that I take a proper look at him. I’ve caught him in a hurry of sorts. His expression strains as he rushes to assemble his stack of letters once more and scans the floor carefully for strays."
    Narrator "But there is also a clarity, a calmness to him. He is in a rush, but he still takes his time to be thorough as he works. He is careful to not inconvenience the other passers-by and apologizes to those rushing by."
    Narrator "In between all this rush, I can see him stealing glances at me out of the corner of my eye."
    Narrator "His gaze burns on my skin, and I turn away, hoping that my face won’t blush and betray me, giving the intensity of this moment away."
    Narrator "Because he isn’t even looking at me in a way of trying to assess my looks- it’s way worse."
    Narrator "An analyzing focus shapes his expression, pressing his lips together in concentration."
    Narrator "He is trying to assess if I’m alright, if I got hurt in the fall- and when he clocks me being careful with my wrist, he grimaces in regret."
    Narrator "But when he looks at me and we both are aware of our attention falling upon the other, his brow unfurrows."

    show i_mysteryR blushing

    Narrator "When his assessment ends and his worry is dampened, what remains is his gentleness. "
    Narrator "He looks at me with earnestness. A pure look of joyous lightlessness befalls him, and I am forced to look away within the course of just a few seconds, suddenly depicting a heightened interest in assembling these letters"
    Narrator "He seeks eye contact."
    Narrator "I’d love to look at him more- I’d love to meet his gaze… \n
            It feels like an easy choice- like it’s the only natural thing to do, to see and be seen by him."
    Narrator "But I just can’t help myself, I can’t help but avoid his eyes sheepishly, his gaze burns upon me more intensely than the afternoon sun earlier today."

    show i_mysteryR blushing

    Narrator "Perhaps if I turn away, my voice will project some amount of confidence."
    Narrator "Ahem. Here goes."

    Me "Yeaah, but I definitely could have been more careful as well- I didn’t think to look where I was going, I’m so sorry… How many of these are there, my g-"
    Me "… My goodness."

    show i_mysteryR laughing

    Narrator "The man halts his process of stacking up the collected letters into different piles, sorting them by some kind of system that I cannot be bothered to try and discern."
    Narrator "He lets out a hearty laugh that brightens up his entire being. "

    mystery_randall "A few, but luckily the last of this batch-."

    Narrator "I decide to take up and occupy the last remaining space on the bench that isn’t taken up by the ever-increasing number of letter-stacks. "
    Narrator "The mystery Mailman is still crouching on the floor organizing his delivery when he starts grinning to himself sheepishly, the kind you get when remembering a joke you made and still quote to this day from childhood."

    show i_mysteryR mischievous

    mystery_randall "I ought to thank you really."
    
    Narrator "I stop playing with the rim of a letter absent-mindedly as my sense of curiosity overrides my shyness."

    Me "What do you mean?"

    show i_mysteryR neutral

    Narrator "He smiles, now him averting my gaze- though I doubt out of shyness. He seems more confident than I- I think?"

    show i_mysteryR laughing

    mystery_randall "Well I was in such a rush earlier, I kinda messed up the sorting system for these- So now I have a chance to actually do it right."

    show i_mysteryR neutral

    Me "Aren’t you still in a rush though? I mean, I’m not really one to judge in this situation, but you didn’t really give off “taking my time”-kinda vibes."

    Narrator "For a second I think he is too absorbed in his work to have heard me until he responds- without looking up."

    mystery_randall "I wasn’t really in a necessary rush- I just tried to get home early before my next shift."

    Narrator "He assigns the last of his letters and looks up to meet my gaze."

    Narrator "The suddenly arisen attention makes it hit more intensely than any previous moment had. And this time- I’m too frozen, to caught off-guard to be able to look away."

    show i_mysteryR blushing

    mystery_randall "I’m pretty sure I still have more than enough time left"

    Narrator "He then reaches over and gently takes the final remaining letter out of my hand and puts it slowly onto a last remaining pile."
    Narrator "For a moment we just stay that way."
    Narrator "It feels peaceful. Just simple and like all is well."
    Narrator "Ok, Cupid. This might be more difficult than anticipated…"

    show i_mysteryR neutral

    Narrator "I suddenly stand up, desperately trying to shake off this weird love magic trick that’s being played on me. It’s just magic."

    Me "Well I AM actually in a rush, so I should get going."

    Narrator "The Mailman stands up surprised, seemingly catching himself and getting a bit embarrassed for getting side-tracked."

    mystery_randall "Oh yea you should probably get going then-"

    Narrator "He haphazardly stands up and starts grabbing the stacks of mail and storing them more clumsily than swiftly in the bag."

    mystery_randall "-I also should get going in a minute anyway. I mean, I do have time still, but I do still have a shift coming up, and if I can manage to get some more work done on my portfolio that would be good-"

    Narrator "Whilst the picking up of the last pile of mail is successful, amidst his rambling the Mailman loses his grip, and the pile threatens to fall."

    show i_mysteryR blushing

    Narrator "With a swift swoop, I manage to grab the pile just in time that it doesn’t fall. My hands instinctively clasp around both the envelopes, as well as the Fingers enveloping parts of them."
    Narrator "We stand there for a moment, lingering."
    Narrator "Staring at first at the stack of envelopes, and then at each other."
    Narrator "I’m suddenly aware of just how close we’re standing… \n
                He smells of Citrus and Sandalwood, crisp and warm."
    Narrator "My breathing feels laboured and straining, and if I hadn’t just been persuaded not to meddle with the games of Gods, I’d pray for him not to notice the sweatiness of my palms or hear the obnoxious drumming of my heart."
    Narrator "He catches himself apparently as his smile widens warmly."

    mystery_randall "Randall."
    mystery_randall "I mean-"
