    Narrator "I blink."
    Narrator "I mean- what else am I supposed to do in a moment like this?"
    Narrator "Dispersed by the recent and SLIGHTLY bewildering events, I stumble my way through the mass of pedestrians on the street."
    Narrator "They’re all way too absorbed in their worlds to notice my staggering step."
    Narrator "I finally make it to a bench by the side of the street without knocking someone over, although I had a very, very close encounter with an elderly woman and her comparably large poodle in my last strides."
    Narrator "I rub my stinging eyes as I try to make sense of the last minutes."
    Narrator "The following relief is only temporary, my eyes becoming so sore from the pressure, that my vision is even more blurry than before."
    Narrator "I let my thoughts catch up for a moment, as I accept that the world is now made up of gently swirling pavement and street signs that are never quite in focus enough to be eligible."
    Narrator "That…"
    Narrator "That can’t have been real?"
    Narrator "What am I even supposed to do in a situation like this?"
    Narrator "Like what, do Gods normally just… interrupt people’s days like that?"
    Narrator "Confuse the hell out of them? "
    Narrator "Make them doubt their own sanity based on- what? "
    Narrator "No rhyme or reason, just… coincidence and whim?"
    Narrator "That would be totally- "
    extend "No that’s actually entirely plausible, checks out."
    Narrator "Ok."
    Narrator "Deal’s a deal."
    Narrator "Can’t be that difficult anyway, right? Just continue life as is, nobody’s lined up to win my heart and they won’t start now."
    Narrator "My vision starts to reset slowly and the fog that rests heavily on my brain clears a little."
    Narrator "I somehow successfully suppress a heavy, bellowing laugh from emerging at the realization of how ridiculous my life has just become-"
    Narrator "- just in time to realize that I must be running late for work at this point."
    Narrator "I wait for another moment on that increasingly uncomfortable bench till my vision clears and I’m able to read the sign of the coffee booth on the other side of the street."
    Narrator "Unfortunately, I’m too busy wondering if it has always had the words “AMBROSIA COFFEE” cursively adorning its side, to notice the passer-by running straight past the bend-"
    #adjust this line later
    Narrator "Right, where I was planning to start planning once more."
