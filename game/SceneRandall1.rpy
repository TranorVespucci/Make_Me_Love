    Narrator "I blink."
    Narrator "I mean- what else am I supposed to do in a moment like this?"
    Narrator "Dispersed by the recent and SLIGHTLY bewildering events, I stumble my way through the mass of pedestrians on the street."
    Narrator "They’re all way too absorbed in their worlds to notice my staggering step."
    Narrator "I finally make it to a bench by the side of the street without knocking someone over, although I had a very, very close encounter with an elderly woman and her comparably large poodle in my last strides."
    Narrator "I rub my stinging eyes as I try to make sense of the last minutes."
    Narrator "The following relief is only temporary, my eyes becoming so sore from the pressure, that my vision is even more blurry than before."
    Narrator "I let my thoughts catch up for a moment, as I accept that the world is now made up of gently swirling pavement and street signs that are never quite in focus enough to be eligible."
    Narrator "That…"
    Narrator "That can’t have been real?"
    Narrator "What am I even supposed to do in a situation like this?"
    Narrator "Like what, do Gods normally just… interrupt people’s days like that?"
    Narrator "Confuse the hell out of them? "
    Narrator "Make them doubt their own sanity based on- what? "
    Narrator "No rhyme or reason, just… coincidence and whim?"
    Narrator "That would be totally- "
    extend "No that’s actually entirely plausible, checks out."
    Narrator "Ok."
    Narrator "Deal’s a deal."
    Narrator "Can’t be that difficult anyway, right? Just continue life as is, nobody’s lined up to win my heart and they won’t start now."
    Narrator "My vision starts to reset slowly and the fog that rests heavily on my brain clears a little."
    Narrator "I somehow successfully suppress a heavy, bellowing laugh from emerging at the realization of how ridiculous my life has just become-"
    Narrator "- just in time to realize that I must be running late for work at this point."
    Narrator "I wait for another moment on that increasingly uncomfortable bench till my vision clears and I’m able to read the sign of the coffee booth on the other side of the street."
    Narrator "Unfortunately, I’m too busy wondering if it has always had the words “AMBROSIA COFFEE” cursively adorning its side, to notice the passer-by running straight past the bend-"
    #adjust this line later
    Narrator "Right, where I was planning to start planning once more."

    mystery_randall "Fu-"
    Narrator "He didn’t seem to be expecting my move either, as our bodies collide with a heavy thunk and we both lose our bearings and fall, inelegantly, onto the concrete."

    Me "Oh my God, I’m so sorry!"

    Narrator "I sit up rashly, ignoring the dull pains in my arms where I awkwardly collide with the concrete, trying to brace my fall. "
    Narrator "The handsome stranger and I are surrounded by a widely dispersed stack of letters, which, apart from a minor few that were a bit more torn and bent than they probably had been before, seemed relatively unharmed."
    Narrator "I immediately jump to action and crawl around alongside him, stuffing the letters back into the now-empty bag marked with a postal symbol. "

    Narrator "He lets out an awkward chuckle, but the crinkling around his eyes as he smiles is genuine."

    mystery_randall "Oh no worries, I shouldn’t have been running anyway- safety hazard and- Ehm- Such."

    Narrator "It is only then that I take a proper look at him. I’ve caught him in a hurry of sorts. His expression strains as he rushes to assemble his stack of letters once more and scans the floor carefully for strays."
    Narrator "But there is also a clarity, a calmness to him. He is in a rush, but he still takes his time to be thorough as he works. He is careful to not inconvenience the other passers-by and apologizes to those rushing by."
    Narrator "In between all this rush, I can see him stealing glances at me out of the corner of my eye."
    Narrator "His gaze burns on my skin, and I turn away, hoping that my face won’t blush and betray me, giving the intensity of this moment away."
    Narrator "Because he isn’t even looking at me in a way of trying to assess my looks- it’s way worse."
    Narrator "An analyzing focus shapes his expression, pressing his lips together in concentration."
    Narrator "He is trying to assess if I’m alright, if I got hurt in the fall- and when he clocks me being careful with my wrist, he grimaces in regret."
    Narrator "But when he looks at me and we both are aware of our attention falling upon the other, his brow unfurrows."

    Narrator "When his assessment ends and his worry is dampened, what remains is his gentleness. "
    Narrator "He looks at me with earnestness. A pure look of joyous lightlessness befalls him, and I am forced to look away within the course of just a few seconds, suddenly depicting a heightened interest in assembling these letters"
    Narrator "He seeks eye contact."
    Narrator "I’d love to look at him more- I’d love to meet his gaze… \n
            It feels like an easy choice- like it’s the only natural thing to do, to see and be seen by him."
    Narrator "But I just can’t help myself, I can’t help but avoid his eyes sheepishly, his gaze burns upon me more intensely than the afternoon sun earlier today."

    Narrator "Perhaps if I turn away, my voice will project some amount of confidence."
    Narrator "Ahem. Here goes."

    Me "Yeaah, but I definitely could have been more careful as well- I didn’t think to look where I was going, I’m so sorry… How many of these are there, my g-"
    Me "… My goodness."

    show i_randall laughing

    Narrator "The man halts his process of stacking up the collected letters into different piles, sorting them by some kind of system that I cannot be bothered to try and discern."
    Narrator "He lets out a hearty laugh that brightens up his entire being. "

    mystery_randall "A few, but luckily the last of this batch-."

    Narrator "I decide to take up and occupy the last remaining space on the bench that isn’t taken up by the ever-increasing number of letter-stacks. "
    Narrator "The mystery Mailman is still crouching on the floor organizing his delivery when he starts grinning to himself sheepishly, the kind you get when remembering a joke you made and still quote to this day from childhood."
